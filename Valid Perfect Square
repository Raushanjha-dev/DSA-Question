Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

//code
 bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int l=1;
        int h=num;
        int ans=0;
        while(l<=h){
            long mid=l+(h-l)/2;
            if(mid*mid==num){
                return true;
            }
            else if(mid*mid<num){
                l=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                h=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
